    For example, for the Adult Income dataset and for f1=education, f2=age, k=3 the constraint that derive from this query for instance x is
   ((y_age = age1) or (y_age = age2) or (y_age = age3)) and (y_education != x.education), where y_f is the (unknown) value of feature f of the counterfactual
   x.f is the value of feature f of instance x and age1, age2, age3 are the 3 smallest ages
